I use city location and population data to answer questions about the cities on our planet such as finding population of specific city and average city population in specific country.


## In this Project, I achieve these functions:

Given a country name using a mix of case, return the country code in all lowercase letters

Find the average population of cities in a country regardless.

Returns a Map[cityName -> population] for all cities in the given county. The name of each city should match exactly how it appears in citiesFilename and the population is read from the file and converted to an Int.
